I am a computer science student at Shenzhen University, with a focus on computer graphics, computer vision and game engine. As an aspiring developer, I am passionate about exploring new technologies and creating immersive experiences that engage and delight users. In my free time, I enjoy tinkering with code, experimenting with different frameworks and libraries, and collaborating with other developers to bring new ideas to life. Whether working on solo projects or contributing to open-source initiatives, I am always looking for ways to expand my skills and knowledge, and to make meaningful contributions to the tech community.
